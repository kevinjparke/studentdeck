# Problem Statement
International students face numerous challenges when moving to another country for higher education. These challenges include finding suitable accommodation, locating reliable roommates, avoiding scams and untrustworthy landlords, and adapting to a new environment. Additionally, connecting with other international students who share similar interests and backgrounds can be difficult. The aim of StudentDeck is to provide a comprehensive solution to these problems by creating a community and a centralized resource for international students.

# Overview
StudentDeck is a platform designed specifically for international students, focusing on facilitating a seamless integration into their new environments. The platform offers a variety of features to address the challenges faced by international students. It provides a community for students to connect with one another, find accommodation through verified realtors and landlords, and share their experiences and lessons learned.

# Core Features
### - Database of Rental Properties: StudentDeck maintains a database of rental properties sourced from verified landlords and real estate agents. This ensures that students have access to reliable and trustworthy accommodation options.

### - Community Blog: Users can share their stories, experiences, and insights through a dedicated blog. The blog serves as a platform for connecting with other members of the community.

### - Roommate Matching: StudentDeck offers a roommate matching feature that helps users find suitable roommates and accommodations based on their preferences. It supports various types of rental arrangements, including sub-leases, lease transfers, and other rental accommodations.

# Technical Details
### - Framework: The project is developed using Spring Boot - Java, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for the application.

### - Database: A relational database is used as a dependency to store and manage the application's data.

### - Agile Development: The project follows Agile principles, ensuring iterative and incremental development. Test-driven development (TDD) is employed, where test cases are written before the actual functional code.

### - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): The project incorporates CI/CD methodologies to ensure seamless integration of code changes and continuous development.

### - S.O.L.I.D Design Principles: The project adheres to the S.O.L.I.D principles of application development, promoting modular, maintainable, and scalable code architecture.

# Contibutions
This was a group effort undertaken by 3 other contributing members. I contributed to this project by building the authentication module and user profile, password hashing funtionality, and all associated unit tests. Finally, I implemented the CI/CD Pipeline on GitLab (where is project is originally hosted). This project was completed in December 2022. I received an A for this project and an A+ overall for this Software Development course.
